Internet-Draft             XMPP POSH Prooftype                 June 2012


1.  Introduction

   The XMPP-DNA specification defines a framework for secure delegation
   and authenticated domain name associations (DNA) in the Extensible
   Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).  This document defines one
   prooftype for DNA, using PKIX certificates obtained over secure HTTP
   ("POSH").


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


3.  Prooftype

   POSH stands for PKIX Over Secure HTTP: the verification material is a
   PKIX certificate [RFC5280], it is obtained by retrieving it over
   HTTPS [RFC2818] at a well-known URI [RFC5785] (see below), the
   certificate is checked according to the rules from [RFC6120] and
   [RFC6125], and secure DNS is not necessary since the HTTPS retrieval
   mechanism relies on the chain of trust from the public key
   infrastructure.

   The process for retrieving a PKIX certificate over secure HTTP is as
   follows.

   1.  The initiating entity performs an HTTPS GET to the path "/.well-
       known/tls/_<service>._tcp<source domain>.cer" to the source
       domain; where "_<service>" MUST be either "_xmpp-client" for XMPP
       client-to-server connections or "_xmpp-server" for XMPP server-
       to-server connections:

   T /.well-known/_xmpp-server._tcp.im.example.com.cer HTTP/1.1
   st: im.example.com


   2.  If the source domain HTTPS server has a certificate for the
       requested path, it MUST respond with a success status code, with
       the message body as the PEM-encoded certificate to expect:

4.  Secure Delegation

   When PKIX Over Secure HTTP (POSH) is the DNA prooftype, it is
   possible to use HTTPS redirects in determining if a domain is
   securely delegated performs the following actions:

   1.  The initiating entity performs an HTTPS GET to the path "/.well-
       known/tls/_<service>._tcp<source-domain>.cer" at the source
       domain; where "_<service>" MUST be either "_xmpp-client" for XMPP
       client-to-server connections or "_xmpp-server" for XMPP server-
       to-server connections.  Here is an example:

   GET /.well-known/_xmpp-server._tcp.im.example.com.cer HTTP/1.1
   Host: im.example.com


   2.  If the source domain HTTPS server has delegated to a derived
       domain, it MUST respond with a 302 Moved; the 'Location' header
       MUST specify an HTTPS URL, where the hostname and port is the
       derived domain HTTPS server, and the path MUST match the pattern
       "_<service>._tcp.<derived domain>.cer"; where "_<service>" MUST
       be identical to the "_<service>" portion of the original request
       (line breaks added for readability):

   HTTP/1.1 302 Found
   Location: https://hosting.example.com/.well-known

             /tls/_xmpp-server._tcp.hosting.example.net.cer


   3.  The initiating entity performs an HTTPS GET to the URL specified
       in the 'Location' header:

   GET /.well-known/tls/_xmpp-server._tcp.hosting.example.cer HTTP/1.1
   Host: hosting.example.net


   4.  If the derived domain HTTPS server has a certificate, it MUST
       respond with a success status code, with the message body as the
       PEM-encoded certificate to expect:
