Internet-Draft                  XMPP DNA                       June 2012


1.  Introduction

   Because the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is
   built upon a distributed client-server architecture [RFC6120], it has
   long included methods for establishing connections among servers on
   the network.  In XMPP, these server-to-server connections typically
   do not require pre-arranged peering agreements and thus are
   negotiated on an ad-hoc or as-needed basis.  Furthermore, to the
   extent that servers "trust" each other, such trust is established
   based on information obtained from the Domain Name System (DNS), the
   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), or similar sources.  Since XMPP
   servers are associated with DNS domain names (or, less commonly, IP
   addresses), server-to-server connectivity is referred to as
   interdomain federation.  This document describes a model for
   interdomain federation and modernizes some federation methods to
   reflect progress in several underlying technologies, especially DNS
   Security [RFC4033].


2.  Terminology

   This document inherits XMPP-related terminology from [RFC6120] and
   [XEP-0220], DNS-related terminology from [RFC1034], [RFC1035],
   [RFC2782] and [RFC4033], and security-related terminology from
   [RFC4949] and [RFC5280].  The terms "source domain" and "derived
   domain" are used as defined in the "CertID" specification [RFC6125].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


3.  Problem Statement

   According to [RFC6120], an identity in the TLS certificate MUST match
   the source domain to established a trusted connection.  However, it
   is operationally not feasible for an XMPP service provider hosting
   multiple domains to hold onto certificates that meet this criteria.
   This has led to a considerable suspension of disbelief by XMPP
   clients (unconditionally accepting the certificate offered) and
   almost a complete lack of secure connections between XMPP servers.

5.  Framework


6.  Validation Prooftypes

6.1.  PKI

6.2.  DANE

6.3.  HTTPS/.well-known/

   This prooftype relies on the existing trust for HTTPS to provide a
   delegation path from a source domain to a target host.

   1.  The initiating entity performs an HTTPS GET to the path "/.well-
       known/tls/<service>.<protocol>.<source-domain>" to the source
       domain (e.g. "https://im.example.com/.well-known/tls/
       _xmpp-client._tcp.im.example.com")
   2.  The source domain HTTPS service SHOULD respond with a 302 Moved;
       the 'Location' header MUST specify an HTTPS URL that directs to
       the target host, and the path MUST be identical to the path of
       the original request (e.g.  "Location: https://
       hosting.example.com/.well-known/tls/
       _xmpp-client._tcp.im.example.com")
   3.  The initiating entity performs an HTTPS GET to the redirected URL
       specified in the 'Location' header
   4.  The target host HTTPS service MUST respond with a success status
       code, with the message body set to the PEM-encoded certificate to
       expect.
