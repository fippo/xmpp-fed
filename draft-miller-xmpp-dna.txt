Internet-Draft                  XMPP DNA                       June 2012


1.  Introduction

   Because the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is
   built upon a distributed client-server architecture [RFC6120], it has
   long included methods for establishing connections among servers on
   the network.  In XMPP, these server-to-server connections typically
   do not require pre-arranged peering agreements and thus are
   negotiated on an ad-hoc or as-needed basis.  Furthermore, to the
   extent that servers "trust" each other, such trust is established
   based on information obtained from the Domain Name System (DNS), the
   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), or similar sources.  Since XMPP
   servers are associated with DNS domain names (or, less commonly, IP
   addresses), server-to-server connectivity is referred to as
   interdomain federation.  This document describes a model for
   interdomain federation and modernizes some federation methods to
   reflect progress in several underlying technologies, especially DNS
   Security [RFC4033].


2.  Terminology

   This document inherits XMPP-related terminology from [RFC6120] and
   [XEP-0220], DNS-related terminology from [RFC1034], [RFC1035],
   [RFC2782] and [RFC4033], and security-related terminology from
   [RFC4949] and [RFC5280].  The terms "source domain" and "derived
   domain" are used as defined in the "CertID" specification [RFC6125].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


3.  Problem Statement

   How did we get here?

   What do we have today?

   Why does it matter? (virtual hosting, delegation)


4.  Requirements

5.  Framework

   concept of "prooftype"

   concept of "assertion"?

   concept of "delegation"?

   what's in a recipe


6.  Prooftypes

   (or: how to obtain verification credentials)

6.1.  PKI

6.2.  DANE

6.3.  HTTPS/.well-known

   This prooftype relies on the existing trust for HTTPS to provide a
   delegation path from a source domain to a target host.

   1.  The initiating entity performs an HTTPS GET to the path "/.well-
       known/tls/_<service>._>protocol>>source domain>" to the source
       domain (e.g. "https://im.example.com/.well-known/.tls/
       _xmpp-server._tcp.im.example.com")
   2.  If the source domain HTTPS server has a certificate for the
       requested path, it MUST respond with a success status code, with
       the message body as the PEM-encoded certificate to expect.



7.  Delegation Methods

7.1.  DNSSEC

7.2.  HTTPS Redirect

   1.  The initiating entity performs an HTTPS GET to the path "/.well-
       known/tls/<service>.<protocol>.<source-domain>" to the source
       domain (e.g. "https://im.example.com/.well-known/tls/
       _xmpp-server._tcp.im.example.com")

   2.  If the source domain HTTPS server has delegated to a derived
       domain, it MUST respond with a 302 Moved; the 'Location' header
       MUST specify an HTTPS URL, where the hostname and port is the

       derived domain HTTPS server, and the path MUST match the pattern
       "_<service>._<protocol>.<derived domain>" (e.g.  "Location: https
       ://hosting.example.com/.well-known/tls/
       _xmpp-server._tcp.hosting.example.net")

   3.  The initiating entity performs an HTTPS GET to the URL specified
       in the 'Location' header.

   4.  If the derived domain HTTPS server has a certificate MUST respond
       with a success status code, with the message body set to the PEM-
       encoded certificate to expect.



8.  Assertion Mechanisms

8.1.  TLS

8.2.  SASL

8.3.  <db:result>

10.  Internationalization Considerations


11.  IANA Considerations
