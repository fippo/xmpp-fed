Internet-Draft                  XMPP DNA                       June 2012


1.  Introduction

   Because the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is
   built upon a distributed client-server architecture [RFC6120], it has
   long included methods for establishing connections among servers on
   the network.  In XMPP, these server-to-server connections typically
   do not require pre-arranged peering agreements and thus are
   negotiated on an ad-hoc or as-needed basis.  Furthermore, to the
   extent that servers "trust" each other, such trust is established
   based on information obtained from the Domain Name System (DNS), the
   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), or similar sources.  Since XMPP
   servers are typically affiliated with DNS domain names, server-to-
   server connectivity is referred to as interdomain federation.  This
   document describes a model for interdomain federation and modernizes
   some federation methods (e.g., Server Dialback [XEP-0220]) to reflect
   progress in several underlying technologies, especially DNS Security
   [RFC4033].  It also generalizes aspects of this model from server-to-
   server streams to also include client-to-server streams, since in
   both cases a server is expected to prove its identity.


2.  Terminology

   This document inherits XMPP-related terminology from [RFC6120] and
   [XEP-0220], DNS-related terminology from [RFC1034], [RFC1035],
   [RFC2782] and [RFC4033], and security-related terminology from
   [RFC4949] and [RFC5280].  The terms "source domain", "derived
   domain", "reference identity", and "presented identity" are used as
   defined in the "CertID" specification [RFC6125].  The terms
   "permissive federation" and "verified federation" are derived from
   [XEP-0238], although we substitute the term "authenticated
   federation" for the term "trusted federation" from that document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


3.  Problem Statement

   In XMPP, each party to a stream expects the other party to provide
   some proof of its identity.  For example, in client-to-server streams
   the server expects the client to present some credentials (such as a
   username and password or a client certificate), and ideally the
   client also expects the server to provide a certificate that
   identifies the domain(s) of the server.  The same is true of server-
   to-server streams.

Internet-Draft                  XMPP DNA                       June 2012


   When the Jabber.org open-source community developed the precursor to
   XMPP in 1999, it defined methods for interdomain federation but no
   mechanisms for authenticating or checking the identity of peer
   servers.  We could describe this as "permissive federation", which is
   clearly suboptimal given the strong potential for domain spoofing.
   In the year 2000, the community filled the gap to some extent by
   defining a technology called Server Dialback (first documented in
   [RFC3920] and since moved to [XEP-0220]).  Although Server Dialback
   does not provide a strong mechanism for identity checking without the
   use of DNSSEC, it does provide DNS-based verification and thus has
   effectively prevented most instances of domain spoofing on the XMPP
   network since late 2000.  Also, because Server Dialback typically
   does not involve the use of server certificates, it does not result
   in an encrypted stream; thus we refer to it as a technology for
   "verified federation".

   In 2002-2004, the IETF's XMPP Working Group hardened the original
   Jabber.org protocols by adding Transport Layer Security (TLS) and
   Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL), thus making it
   possible for two servers to engage in "authenticated federation"
   (i.e., when two peer servers present PKIX certificates during
   negotiation of a server-to-server stream).  Unfortunately,
   authenticated federation has not been widely deployed; one of the
   primary reasons is that it is feasible (although not always easy) for
   single-domain servers to obtain the proper certificates, but much
   more difficult (or practically impossible) for large XMPP hosting
   providers to do so.  The primary challenge here is operational: it is
   highly unlikely that an organization (say, example.com) wishing to
   delegate its XMPP service (say, im.example.com) to a hosting provider
   (say, hosting.example.net) will hand over its private key to the
   hosting provider.  Even if that were feasible, further operational
   challenges (e.g., maintaining large numbers of certificates for
   hosted domains, and configuring XMPP software to present the correct
   certificate based on the 'to' address of the initial stream header)
   have also discouraged deployment of authenticated federation in
   virtual hosting environments, which happen to be quite common on the
   XMPP network.

   Furthermore, the prevalence of delegation to hosting providers leads
   to one additional shortcoming, caused by the use of DNS SRV records
   [RFC2782] in XMPP: if DNSSEC is not used, the act of delegation is
   inherently insecure.  Unfortunately, no existing documentation
   explains how to use DNSSEC for secure delegation, with the result
   that clients and servers often take a "leap of faith" if using an SRV
   record to determine that when communicating with, say, im.example.com
   they actually need to connect to, say, hosting.example.net.

   Thus at present authenticated federation is uncommon on the XMPP

   network and secure delegation is unheard of.  Because encryption of
   server-to-server streams is desirable and because delegation needs to
   be secure if it can be trusted at all by peer servers and end-user
   clients, the current situation is clearly sub-optimal.  This document
   defines some ways to overcome these problems and therefore improve
   the security of the XMPP network.


4.  Framework

   In essence, we need to establish an association between a domain and
   an XML stream: is the XMPP server to which a client or peer server
   connects "allowed" to accept stanzas for or send stanzas from a given
   domain?  If so, we say that there is a domain name association
   ("DNA") for the stream.

   For TLS in general, the TLS client has some expectations about the
   identity of the TLS server (in the language of the "CertID"
   specification [RFC6125], the TLS client has a "reference identity"),
   and then checks some material presented by the TLS server (the
   "presented identity" within the server certificate) to verify that
   its expectations have been met.  In XMPP, Server Dialback follows a
   similar model, except that the verification material takes the form
   of a token instead of a certificate.  The DNS-Based Authentication of
   Named Entities protocol [DANE], at least in some of its modes, adds
   another kind of verification material: not the presented identity
   within a PKIX certificate, but a complete certificate or hash
   thereof.  And other kinds of verification material could be
   envisioned (e.g., OpenPGP keys, Kerberos tickets, and OAuth tokens),
   although they are not considered here.

   No matter what kind of verification material is used, an XMPP client
   or server that wishes to verify a domain name association needs a way
   to obtain the verification material it will refer to when
   establishing the association.  For instance, when an server presents
   a PKIX certificate during TLS negotiation, the connecting client or
   peer server has traditionally obtained its verification material out
   of band or via configuration from a certification authority (i.e., in
   the form of a root certificate contained in a certificate bundle).
   In the Server Dialback protocol, the verification material is a token
   that is obtained over XMPP itself.  In DANE, the verification
   material is obtained from the Domain Name System.  In the PKIX Over
   Secure HTTP ("POSH") method described under Section 5.3, the
   verification material is obtained over secure HTTP.  And other
   methods for obtaining verification material could be envisioned
   (e.g., IPsec), although they are not considered here.

   Furthermore, the matching rules for checking the verification



Saint-Andre & Miller    Expires December 23, 2012               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                  XMPP DNA                       June 2012


   material will depend on the nature of that material; for example,
   [RFC6120] defines a profile of the rules from the "CertID"
   specification [RFC6125], Server Dialback [XEP-0220] typically
   performs a character-for-character comparison of tokens, DANE might
   compare the SubjectPublicKeyInfo data or the full certificate, and so
   on.

   Finally, given the relationship between XMPP and the DNS (XMPP
   services are usually identified by domain name, not IP address), it
   is important to make it clear whether a given verification method can
   be used only with secure DNS or also with insecure DNS.

   Putting these pieces together, we define a DNA prooftype as follows.

   prooftype:  A mechanism for proving an association between a domain
      name and an XML stream, where the mechanism defines (1) the
      verification material to be used, (2) the matching rules for
      comparing the reference version and presented version of the
      material, (3) how the verification material is obtained, and (4)
      whether the mechanism depends on Secure DNS.

   The following sections define several prooftypes that are used, or
   could be used, in XMPP.

   Note: So far, our definition of a prooftype does not include the
   exact protocol mechanism that is used to assert a domain name; this
   is explained further under Section 6.


5.  Prooftypes

5.1.  PKI

   The PKI prooftype is a DNA proof that follows the rules from
   [RFC6120]: that is, the verification materials consist of a PKIX
   certificate that is checked according to a profile of the matching
   rules from [RFC6125], the client's verification materials are
   obtained out of band in the form of a trusted root, and secure DNS is
   not necessary.

5.2.  DANE

   In the DANE prooftype, the verification materials consist of a PKIX
   certificate that is compared as an exact match or a hash of either
   the SubjectPublicKeyInfo or the full certificate, and the
   verification materials are obtained via secure DNS.

5.3.  POSH

   POSH stands for PKIX Over Secure HTTP: the verification material is a
   PKIX certificate, it is obtained by retrieving it over HTTPS at a
   well-known URI [RFC5785] (see below), the certificate is checked
   according to the rules from [RFC6120] and [RFC6125], and secure DNS
   is not necessary since the HTTPS retrieval mechanism relies on the
   chain of trust from the public key infrastructure.

   The process for retrieving a PKIX certificate over secure HTTP is as
   follows.

   1.  The initiating entity performs an HTTPS GET to the path "/.well-
       known/tls/_<service>._tcp<source domain>.cer" to the source
       domain; where "_<service>" MUST be either "_xmpp-client" for XMPP
       client-to-server connections or "_xmpp-server" for XMPP server-
       to-server connections:

   GET /.well-known/_xmpp-server._tcp.im.example.com.cer HTTP/1.1
   Host: im.example.com


   2.  If the source domain HTTPS server has a certificate for the
       requested path, it MUST respond with a success status code, with
       the message body as the PEM-encoded certificate to expect:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/pkix-cert
   Content-Length: 839

5.4.  Dialback Keys

   The Dialback Keys prooftype formalizes the existing Server Dialback:
   the verification material is a token obtained over XMPP and verified
   by the authoritative server for a given domain; secure DNS is needed
   in order to place significant trust in such tokens, although it is
   known that at the time of this writing many domains use Dialback Keys
   even in the absence of secure DNS.


6.  Assertion Mechanisms

   An assertion is a server's statement that an XML stream is to be
   associated with the asserted domain.

6.1.  TLS

   During TLS negotiation, an XMPP server acting as a TLS sever sends
   its certificate to the connecting client or peer server acting as a
   TLS client.  This certificate is interpreted as an assertion of the
   server's identity.

6.2.  SASL

   During SASL negotiation after TLS negotiation, a client or server can
   include an authorization identity; such an authzid is an assertion of
   identity.

6.3.  <db:result>

   When two servers use the Server Dialback protocol [XEP-0220], the
   originating server asserts its identity by sending a <db:result/>
   element to the receiving server, where the 'from' attribute specifies
   the domain name being asserted by the originating server.

   Note: Although historically the <db:result/> element has contained a
   dialback key as XML character data, the <db:result/> element can also
   be used without dialback keys as a mere assertion; this usage is
   sometimes colloquially referred to as "dialback without dialback".

6.4.  A Note about Stream Attributes

   XML streams include 'to' and 'from' attributes.  However, these are
   not assertions of identity, and are merely early indications of the
   identity that a client or server will later assert during TLS
   negotiation, SASL negotiation, or Server Dialback negotiation.

7.  Delegation Methods

   Although domain name associations are closely tied to delegation in
   some scenarios, delegation is irrelevant when the source domain is
   exactly the same as the hostname of the XMPP service, as is often the
   case with single-domain services.  This section defines two methods
   for secure delegation.

7.1.  DNSSEC

   Traditionally, XMPP services have used DNS SRV records [RFC2782] for
   delegation purposes; however, delegation via SRV is insecure absent
   the use of DNSSEC.  An XMPP client or server that wishes to use
   DNSSEC in determining if a domain is securely delegated performs the
   following actions:

   1.  Query for the appropriate SRV resource record for the source
       domain (e.g. "_xmpp-client._tcp.im.example.com").

   2.  If there is no SRV resource record, pursue the fallback methods
       described in [RFC6120].

   3.  If there is an SRV resource record, validate that the SRV record
       answer is secure according to [RFC4033].  If the answer is
       insecure, then delegation to the derived domain(s), as indicated
       by the "target host" field, is insecure and the TLS client MUST
       treat only the source domain as a reference identifier during
       certificate verification, as described in [RFC6120]; if the
       answer is bogus, the TLS client MUST abort.

   4.  If the answer is secure, the TLS client SHOULD consider any
       derived domain(s) in the answer as securely delegated; during
       certificate verification, the TLS client MUST treat both the
       source domain and the derived domain to which it has connected as
       reference identifiers.

7.2.  HTTPS Redirect

   Here we define an alternative method of secure delegation for use
   with PKIX Over Secure HTTP (POSH).  An XMPP client or server that
   wishes to use HTTPS redirects in determining if a domain is securely
   delegated performs the following actions:

   1.  The initiating entity performs an HTTPS GET to the path "/.well-
       known/tls/_<service>._tcp<source-domain>.cer" at the source
       domain; where "_<service>" MUST be either "_xmpp-client" for XMPP
       client-to-server connections or "_xmpp-server" for XMPP server-
       to-server connections.  Here is an example:

   GET /.well-known/_xmpp-server._tcp.im.example.com.cer HTTP/1.1
   Host: im.example.com


   2.  If the source domain HTTPS server has delegated to a derived
       domain, it MUST respond with a 302 Moved; the 'Location' header
       MUST specify an HTTPS URL, where the hostname and port is the
       derived domain HTTPS server, and the path MUST match the pattern
       "_<service>._tcp.<derived domain>.cer"; where "_<service>" MUST
       be identical to the "_<service>" portion of the original request
       (line breaks added for readability):

   HTTP/1.1 302 Found
   Location: https://hosting.example.com/.well-known
             /tls/_xmpp-server._tcp.hosting.example.net.cer


   3.  The initiating entity performs an HTTPS GET to the URL specified
       in the 'Location' header:

   GET /.well-known/tls/_xmpp-server._tcp.hosting.example.cer HTTP/1.1
   Host: hosting.example.net


   4.  If the derived domain HTTPS server has a certificate, it MUST
       respond with a success status code, with the message body as the
       PEM-encoded certificate to expect:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
