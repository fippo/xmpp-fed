1.  Introduction

   In the core XMPP specification [RFC6120], the domain to which an
   originating server wants to connect is asserted via the 'to'
   attribute of the <stream:stream> header, and the TLS certificate
   offered by the receiving server is required to match this source
   domain (e.g., "im.example.com").  However, this model can cause
   problems if the source domain is delegated (via DNS SRV records
   [RFC2782]) to a host associated with a different domain that is
   derived via SRV (e.g., "hosting.example.net"), since the derived
   domain might also be the delegate for a number of other source
   domains and, for operational and security reasons, a hosting server
   is rarely able to present a certificate that matches the source
   domain.

   Absent the use of DNS Security [RFC4033], delegation via SRV does not
   provide a strong basis for checking the derived domain rather than
   the source domain.  This document describes how the use of DNSSEC
   with SRV results in more secure delegation, such that the originating
   XMPP server can legitimately check the derived domain rather than the
   source domain.

2.  Terminology

   This document inherits XMPP-related terminology from [RFC6120], DNS-
   related terminology from [RFC1034], [RFC1035], [RFC2782] and
   [RFC4033], and security-related terminology from [RFC4949] and
   [RFC5280].  The terms "source domain" and "derived domain" are used
   as defined in the "CertID" specification [RFC6125].

   This document is applicable to connections made from an XMPP client
   to an XMPP server ("_xmpp-client._tcp") or between XMPP servers
   ("_xmpp-server._tcp").  In both cases, the originating entity acts as
   a TLS client and the receiving entity acts as a TLS server.
   Therefore, to simplify discussion this document uses "_xmpp-
   client._tcp" to describe to both cases, unless otherwise indicated.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  Use of DNSSEC

   An XMPP initiating entity (TLS client) that wishes to use this
   prooftype performs the following actions:

Internet-Draft           XMPP DNSSEC Prooftype                 June 2012


   1.  Query for the appropriate SRV resource record for the source
       domain (e.g.  "_xmpp-client._tcp.im.example.com").

   2.  If there is no SRV resource record, pursue the fallback methods
       described in [RFC6120].

   3.  If there is an SRV resource record, validate that the SRV record
       answer is provably secure according to [RFC4033]; if the answer
       is not secure or is bogus, then delegation to the derived domain
       (as indicated by the "target host" field) is not secure and the
       TLS client MUST verify the certificate against the source domain
       as described in [RFC6120].

   4.  If there is an SRV record, for each derived domain from the SRV
       record answer (e.g.  "hosting.example.net"), query for the "A"
       and/or "AAAA" resource records as described in [RFC6120].

   5.  For each derived domain, validate that the address record answers
       are provably secure according to [RFC4033]

   6.  If any answer is not secure or is bogus, then the TLS client MUST
       NOT consider a connection to that derived domain as securely
       delegated from the source domain; when verifying the certificate,
       the TLS client MUST do so against the source domain as described
       in [RFC6120].

   7.  For each address record answer that is a provably secure, the TLS
       client SHOULD consider a connection to that derived domain as
       securely delegated; when verifying the certificate (as described
       in [RFC6125]), the TLS client SHOULD do so against the derived
       domain but MAY also verify the certificate against the source
       domain.

4.  Use of DANE

   Whether it is appropriate to use [DANE] for TLS certificate
   verification depends on the delegation status of the source domain,
   as described in the following sections.

4.1.  No Delegation

   If the source domain has not been delegated to a derived domain,
   i.e., if the source domain and the derived domain are identical
   (e.g., "im.example.com"), then the TLS client MAY query for a TLSA
   resource record as described in [DANE], where the prepared domain
   name MUST contain the source domain and a port of 5222 for client-to-
   server streams  (e.g.  "_5222._tcp.im.example.com") or 5269 for
   server-to-server streams (e.g.  "_5269._tcp.im.example.com").

   In this case, the TLS client MUST perform certificate verification
   against the source domain as described in [RFC6120].

4.2.  Insecure Delegation



Miller & Saint-Andre              std                           [Page 3]

Internet-Draft           XMPP DNSSEC Prooftype                 June 2012


   If the delegation of a source domain to a derived domain is not
   proved secure, then the TLS client MUST NOT make a TLSA record query
   as described in [DANE] and the TLS client MUST perform certificate
   verification against the source domain as described in [RFC6120].

4.3.  Secure Delegation

   If the source domain has been delegated to a derived domain in a
   secure manner as described under [protocol], then the TLS client
   SHOULD query for a TLSA resource record as described in [DANE], where
   the prepared domain name MUST contain the derived domain and a port
   of 5222 for client-to-server streams or 5269 for server-to-server
   streams (e.g.  "_5222._tcp.hosting.example.net").

   If no TLSA resource records exist for the specified service, then the
   TLA client MUST perform certificate verification against the source
   domain as described in [RFC6120].

   If TLSA resource records exist for the specified service, then the
   TLS client MUST perform certificate verification against the derived
   domain, using the information from the TLSA answer as the basis for
   verification as described in [DANE].

4.4.  TLSA Certificate Usage 3 Considerations

   If a TLSA resource record specifies certificate usage 3 (also known
   as "domain-issued certificate"), verification MUST NOT consider the
   source or derived domain.  Instead, the target certificate MUST match
   the TLSA record, as specified in [DANE].  If matched, the TLS
   connection MUST considered valid for the source domain regardless of
   the target certificate's information.

5.  Internationalization Considerations

   If the SRV, A/AAAA, and TLSA record queries are for an
   internationalized domain name, then they need to use the A-label form
   as defined in [RFC5890].

6.  Security Considerations

   This document supplements but does not supersede the security
   considerations provided in [RFC4033], [RFC6120], [RFC6125], and
   [DANE].

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for the IANA.
